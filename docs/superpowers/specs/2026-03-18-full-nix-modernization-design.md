# Full Nix Modernization — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-03-18
**Status:** Approved

## Goal

Eliminate custom-where-standards-exist patterns, remove a plaintext-secret footgun, and make the codebase feel like idiomatic NixOS — cohesive and easy to set up for the developer, end users, and contributors.

## Scope

Four focused changes, each independently deliverable.

---

## 1. Remove WiFi NixOS Option

### Problem

`bloom-network.nix` exposes `bloom.wifi.ssid` and `bloom.wifi.psk` as NixOS options. If set, the PSK lands in the Nix store in plaintext. A TODO comment acknowledges this but leaves it unresolved.

### Solution

Delete the `bloom.wifi.ssid` / `bloom.wifi.psk` options and the `environment.etc."NetworkManager/system-connections/wifi.nmconnection"` block from `bloom-network.nix` entirely.

WiFi is already configured correctly by two other paths:
- The Calamares installer sets it during graphical install
- The first-boot wizard (`setup-wizard.sh`) configures it interactively via NetworkManager

Neither path touches the Nix store. No secrets infrastructure (sops-nix, agenix) is needed — removing the option is sufficient.

### Files Changed

- `core/os/modules/network.nix` — remove `options.bloom.wifi` block and `environment.etc` nmconnection block

Note: `bloom-options.nix` does not declare wifi options (it only contains `bloom.username`) and requires no changes.

---

## 2. Sway Config + Shell Cleanup

### Problem

`bloom-shell.nix` embeds a 90-line Sway config inside a bash heredoc that runs conditionally on first login:

```bash
if [ ! -f "$HOME/.config/sway/config" ]; then
  mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/sway"
  cat > "$HOME/.config/sway/config" <<'SWAYCFG'
  ...90 lines...
  SWAYCFG
fi
```

This has two problems:
1. **Not rebuild-safe** — the config is written once and never updated by `nixos-rebuild switch`
2. **Hidden in bash** — config is buried inside a string inside a Nix string, hard to find and edit

Additionally, `.bashrc` manually sets `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="/run/user/$(id -u)"`. NixOS manages this automatically via `pam_systemd` — manual override is redundant and can cause issues.

### Solution

**Sway config:** Extract the config to `environment.etc."xdg/sway/config"` (→ `/etc/xdg/sway/config`). Sway's config lookup order is: `$SWAY_CONFIG` → `~/.config/sway/config` → `~/.sway/config` → `/etc/xdg/sway/config` → `/etc/sway/config`. The correct `environment.etc` path for a NixOS system-wide config is `xdg/sway/config`, which maps to `/etc/xdg/sway/config` — picked up before `/etc/sway/config` and consistent with `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` on NixOS.

Remove the `if [ ! -f ~/.config/sway/config ]` bash block and the heredoc from `.bash_profile`.

**Migration note:** Existing installs that already had `~/.config/sway/config` written by the old bash code will continue using that file (it takes precedence over `/etc/xdg/sway/config`). This is acceptable — the file is functionally identical to the new system config. The rebuild-safe guarantee applies to new installs and any user who manually removes `~/.config/sway/config`.

**XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:** Remove the `export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=...` line from the `.bashrc` template in `bloom-shell.nix`. No replacement needed.

### Files Changed

- `core/os/modules/shell.nix`:
  - Add `environment.etc."xdg/sway/config".text = ''...sway config content...''`
  - Remove Sway config heredoc from `bashProfile`
  - Remove `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` export from `bashrc`

## 3. Cachix Binary Cache

### Problem

`bloom-update.nix` has a commented-out TODO for Cachix:

```nix
# TODO: replace <cachix-url> and <cachix-pubkey> with real Cachix cache values
# nix.settings.substituters = [ ... ];
# nix.settings.trusted-public-keys = [ ... ];
```

Every `nixos-rebuild` on-device compiles the full closure from source. Updates take 20–60+ minutes depending on hardware.

### Solution

**Step 1 — Create Cachix cache:** Create a Cachix cache (e.g. `os`) at cachix.org. Free for public repositories.

**Step 2 — Wire into `bloom-update.nix`:** Uncomment and fill in the substituter and public key:

```nix
nix.settings.substituters = [
  "https://cache.nixos.org"
  "https://os.cachix.org"
];
nix.settings.trusted-public-keys = [
  "cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY="
  "os.cachix.org-1:<pubkey>"
];
```

**Step 3 — Extend the existing `build-os.yml` workflow:** The existing `.github/workflows/build-os.yml` already uses `DeterminateSystems/magic-nix-cache-action`, which caches Nix build artifacts within GitHub's infrastructure (speeds up CI). This is separate from Cachix — `magic-nix-cache-action` is GitHub-internal and not accessible to on-device `nixos-rebuild`.

Cachix provides a public substituter that on-device users can pull from. Modify `build-os.yml` as follows:

1. Add `cachix/cachix-action` step immediately **before** the existing build steps (after `magic-nix-cache-action`). `cachix-action` must precede builds to act as a substituter and to automatically capture all built store paths.
2. Add an explicit `nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.config` step alongside the existing `nix build .#app` step — the existing eval step (`nix eval .#nixosConfigurations.bloom-x86_64.config.system.stateVersion`) evaluates only a single attribute and does not build the full system closure. Note: `checks.x86_64-linux.config` builds `nixosConfigurations.installed-test` (the Calamares-installed config) — this is distinct from `bloom-x86_64` (the bare-metal config) but represents what end users actually run. Both `app` and `config` closures should be pushed to Cachix.
3. `cachix-action` automatically pushes all new store paths built during the job to `os.cachix.org`.

No new workflow file is needed. `magic-nix-cache-action` and `cachix-action` coexist: the former speeds up CI, the latter populates the public substituter for on-device use.

The signing key lives only in GitHub Actions secrets — never in the repo.

### Benefit

- End users: `nixos-rebuild` fetches pre-built binaries — updates take minutes
- Contributors: `nix build` pulls from cache — no local compilation
- Automatic: cache stays warm on every merge to main

### Files Changed

- `core/os/modules/update.nix` — uncomment and fill in substituters
- `.github/workflows/build-os.yml` — add Cachix push step (no new workflow file needed)

## 4. Dev Shell

### Problem

`flake.nix` has no `devShells` output. Contributors must either install Bloom OS or manually figure out what tools are needed (Node, TypeScript, vitest, biome, shellcheck, jq, etc.). Some of these tools appear in `environment.systemPackages` in `bloom-network.nix` (biome, shellcheck, jq, typescript), but they require a full OS install to get. Others (vitest, nodejs) are not system packages at all — they're currently only available via the npm workspace or not at all outside the OS.

### Solution

Add `devShells.${system}.default` to `flake.nix`. Running `nix develop` from the repo root drops into a shell with everything needed to work on the codebase — no Bloom OS install required, works on any NixOS or nix-enabled machine including macOS.

**Included tools:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `nodejs` | Runtime for daemon and extensions |
| `typescript` | Type checking |
| `vitest` | Test runner (available in nixpkgs) |
| `biome` | Linting and formatting |
| `shellcheck` | Shell script linting |
| `jq` | JSON manipulation |
| `curl`, `git` | General tooling |
| `just` | Task runner (`just test`, `just lint`) |

The `devShell` does **not** include Nix-specific system services (localai, continuwuity) — those run on the OS. The shell is for code authoring and testing only.

The dev shell is **additive** — the tools listed also appear in `environment.systemPackages` in `bloom-network.nix` for the installed OS. That list is not changed; the dev shell simply makes those same tools available without a full OS install.

### Files Changed

- `flake.nix` — add `devShells.${system}.default`

---

## Out of Scope

- **home-manager** — the current `/etc/skel` + tmpfiles approach works and is simpler for this use case. home-manager would add input pinning complexity and contributor overhead without meaningful benefit.
- **sops-nix / agenix** — not needed once the WiFi option is removed. The Matrix token is correctly generated at runtime.
- **TypeScript/extension refactoring** — out of scope; patterns are consistent and appropriate.
- **Shell script checkpoint system** — works well, not reinventing anything.

---

## Delivery Order

1. Remove WiFi option (smallest change, immediate security improvement)
2. Sway config + shell cleanup (self-contained NixOS module change)
3. Dev shell (flake.nix addition, unblocks contributors for code authoring and testing)
4. Cachix (requires external Cachix account setup first, then code change + CI step; unblocks contributors and end users from slow on-device build times)

Steps 3 and 4 both benefit contributors but in different ways: the dev shell enables working on the codebase without a Bloom OS install; Cachix eliminates 20–60+ minute `nixos-rebuild` times on-device. Cachix is last only because it requires creating an external account — the code change itself is small.
